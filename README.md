# Test task for Zimalab

This is quick example of PHP web page implementing CRUD-like actions with accounts.
Made with MySQL 8.3.0 (probably will work with earlier versions) and PHP 8.2.

connection.php contains DB connection properties.

create-schema.sql contains SQL setup script.

index.php - web page.
